Reflection time! Boom!

Reflection: Overall, this was a very smooth session, and made me feel like I’ve made progress with understanding and using HTML — but that I have so much more to learn! 

What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
HTML5 semantic tags solve some structural issues with HTML4, and serve to make page content meaningful to tools for people with disabilities (for example, using the <main> tag highlights the page’s main content (ie. article text) for a screen reader.) The tags that allow for clearly delineating navigational information (<nav>,<header>,<footer>) are really useful, as trying to create or position those elements linearly was a challenge I experienced in the past.

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
It defaults to top-to-bottom, left-to-right.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
Snippet creating was a big Sublime learn, and I will definitely create more snippets. I think it’s really cool to be able to focus on templating repetitive functions (like basic section tags with an <h2>, <p>, and <img>, for example), and I will be using this in the future.

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
Learning the nuances of HTML5 is definitely the biggest learning curve. We found a lot of nuance in <article> versus <section>, as well as in <nav> versus <header> or <footer>. Ultimately, seeking and getting more exposure to use cases for semantic HTML will help me understand the whats and whys of it, and I plan to do more research (especially where I can find videos with visual examples, which work best for my learning style.)
