<h2>It's no secret that we live in times that feel remarkably polarized.</h2>

<p>There are <strong>so many</strong> options for the expression of righteous and jusified outrage. Here are a bunch of things you should do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Call your representatives. <a href="http://whoismyrepresentative.com/">Here's an easy way to find out who to talk to.</a></li>
<li>Donate money to non-profits that represent your values. Even $5/month makes a difference.</li>
<li>Boycott brands and businesses that give money to candidates you oppose. For example, try using your local credit union instead of a big bank.</li>
<li><a href="https://lifehacker.com/why-self-care-is-so-important-1770880812">Actively engage in self-care.</a></li>
</ul>
<em>What, what? Self care?</em>
<p>Yep, self-care is more important than ever these days. Why?</p>
<ol>
<li>You can't support others when you're mentally and physically drained. And supporting others is what this is all about.</li>
<li>Self-care activity directly counteracts the negative effects of consuming depressing news all day.</li>
<li>Taking care of yourself reminds you that there are reasons to resist, and important things to fight for.</li>
<li>Self-care improves your mental acuity, aka helps you tune in to what may or may not be BS.</li>
</ol>
