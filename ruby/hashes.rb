#Your program should ...

#Prompt the designer/user for all of this information.
#Convert any user input to the appropriate data type.
#Print the hash back out to the screen when the designer has answered all of the questions.
#Give the user the opportunity to update a key (no need to loop, once is fine). 
# After all, sometimes users make mistakes! If the designer says "none", skip it. 
#But if the designer enters "decor_theme" (for example), your program 
#should ask for a new value and update the :decor_theme key. 
#(Hint: Strings have methods that will turn them into symbols, which would be quite handy here.) 
#You can assume the user will correctly input a key that exists in your hash -- no need to handle user errors.
#Print the latest version of the hash, and exit the program.

#the client's name, age, number of children, decor theme, 
#and so on (you can choose your own as long as it's a good mix of string, integer, and boolean data).

#Pseudocode!

#Initialize hash
#Ask user questions
#Assign hash keys to questions
#Convert user response data to correct data type
#Store data in hash key correlating with question
#Once user is done entering information, print out results with hash keys and user-entered answers
#Ask user if they would like to update any given answer:
# - If user responds "none" or "no", thank them and skip to final step
# - If user responds with a hash key they want to update, have them enter the new value for that key
# - Note: no loop built for multiple key updates, per instructions
#Print out final form
