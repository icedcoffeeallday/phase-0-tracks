# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control keeps track of and surfaces the history of changes made to one or more files, such as codebases. Version control software allows multiple users to work on the same file, then merge and reconcile their changes into the master file. This is extremely useful for engineering teams, who are often working on features to be added to the same codebase.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a copy of the file or directory you're modifying. Developers use branches so that features can be created, tested, and cleaned up before being merged with the master (often user-facing or production) code base.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a record or snapshot of your updated code. A good commit message clearly states what feature or changes have been made in the version of the code or file you're committing.
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict occurs when different edits are made to the same line in a given file, then those files are merged back into the master from which they're branched.
